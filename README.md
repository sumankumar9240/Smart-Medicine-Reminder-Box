## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Medicine Reminder Box** is an Arduino-based embedded system that alerts the user at scheduled medicine times. When the preset time is reached, the system activates a buzzer and displays a reminder on the LCD. The user can acknowledge the reminder by pressing a button, making the system simple and easy to use.

## 💻 Software Used

* Arduino IDE / Visual Studio Code
* Arduino C++
* Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The RTC module continuously keeps track of the current time.
2. Medicine reminder times are stored in the Arduino program.
3. When the current time matches a scheduled reminder:

   * The buzzer starts ringing.
   * A reminder message appears on the LCD.
4. The user presses the acknowledgement button after taking the medicine.
5. The alarm stops and the system waits for the next scheduled reminder.
